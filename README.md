This is why the user can chose between Evora, Coimbra, Braga and Aveiro. 
The goal is in the end to spread recommendations across Portugal.

The user can chose the city he/ she wants to visit. Afterwards it provides recommendations for hotels, activities or restaurant in that city. 
Afterwards the user can check the way to the destination, the estimated travel time, the route and the weather.
